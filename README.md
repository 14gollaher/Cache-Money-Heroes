Cache Money Heroes is a product of head-first learning game design in Unity and C#! This game is inspired by Realm of the Mad God and Binding of Issac. In our game, you are aiming to kill the final boss - "The Dragon of Death!" First you must find all keys to the castles found across four regions of an outdoor world. After collecting all keys, proceed to the castle where you will fight your way through rooms of whimsy and monsters. Once you reach the top of the castle, you are ready to face the final boss - "The Dragon of Death!"

The game was a lot of fun, and was an incredibly valuable experience to learn basic game development and use modern game creation tools. In this project we used C# and Unity to produce our game. 

Much of this game is still open to development (completing wizard and knight classes, new levels, bug fixes, etc.). But, you may download the executable game file and play through the first release as an Archer. Check the "Controls" screen ingame for help and controls to the game!

I also was curious how to post a Unity game online. Thus, after many attempts, I produced a small, sometimes working online demo. Due to performance capacities and file upload limits on hosting sites - I had to strip out the entire outdoor world, remove many core components including skills and much of the UI, tone down how many monsters you fought per room, and lower some graphics and resolutions. Nonetheless, about some users may view the basic demo here: http://www.mattgollaher.com/cache-money-heroes
